## My process

My first step was to get familiar with object oriented programming in javascript, having information about constructor functions, 
ES6 Classes and object.create() function this allowed me to acquire knowledge about encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism which 
has allowed me to develop this application based on public and private properties as well as public and private methods. This helped me to be more 
confident with javascript and get more knowledge that will allow me to be part of big projects in the future.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript ES6
- OOP paradigm

### What I learned

In this learning process I have been able to increase my skills on the OOP-paradigm in addition to being able to become more 
familiar with constructor functions, ES6 Classes and Object.create().

## Acknowledgments

I am very happy to continue advancing in this learning process, I know that for each person in this world of programming it is different, 
some of us take more time than others, but the important thing is that if something that we are passionate about is something that we must follow and if 
it is something that you have fun it is not work. I just know that every step that i have took are taking me to a better place
